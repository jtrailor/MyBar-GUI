# MyBar-GUI
A Java based tool that can generate drink combinations.

Problem: Create a tool that will return relevant drink combinations based on the ingredients inputted by the user. Tool should be GUI based.

Approach: Tool created using Java's Swing and AWT frameworks. These allowed for the creation of a GUI to input data and output results. The entire program is organized using the MVC design pattern. Data for the tool comes from an integrated MySQL database connection. The database is hosted locally on my computer. A model determines the most appropriate cocktails based on inputted ingredients, which is then returned to the user.

Challenges: I am a SQL novice and it took a considerable amount of time to form a connection to the MySQL database. It also took a substantial amount of effort to successfully write the various SQL queries and statements in Java to retrieve data from and add data to the tables in the database.

Technologies: Java, Event Driven Programming, Object Oriented Design, MVC Design Pattern, MySQL, SQL Integrated Applications

Results: An operational tool that returns relevant cocktails based on inputted ingredients. Also added functionality that allows for individual ingredients, along with drinks and their corresponding ingredients to be added to the database from the tool. Please see attached photos of the tool in operation!
